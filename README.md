# DS Pokemon Rom Editor

Nomura's C# and WinForm DS Pokemon ROM Editor forked with some QOL adjustments.

## Motivation

As DSPRE is currently undergoing an overhaul towards Java, I have forked and added some additions for myself in the meantime. These are all some simple QOL improvements.

## Changes to original

The current list of modified features is as follows:

### Finished additions
1. Line numbers in script editor.
2. A couple of patches here and there for certain unhandled exceptions.

### Almost finished
1. Full repair of script editor saving for HGSS.
2. Overworld sprite loading repair. Now that proper table format known should be relatively easy.

### Building blocks set
1. Internal camera preview and edit
2. BW2 compatability ([explained more in depth below](#bw2-support-plans))

### Planned
1. Script editor syntax highlight

## BW2 support plans

When I have time I will little by little be adding stuff for BW2, initial plan is Text files, then Maps, then Pok√©mon, and so on.

Do not expect any updates on this soon or with any consistency, this is purely done because I like to code and I wanted to see if I understand DS ROM hacking enough to be able to add BW2 to DSPRE.
